    <h3 id='first_week_of_portland_code_school__lessons_learned'>First week of Portland Code School - Lessons Learned</h3>

<p><code>&lt;ul id=&quot;random-thoughts&quot;&gt;</code></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>There are only so many hours in the day, pick your battles and make sure have something interesting to ask or bring up for the next day&#8217;s class. Specifically, <strong>DO YOUR HOMEWORK</strong>, it will pay off in class when you can actually put the teacher to use. A schedule and notes will help with all of the above.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Don’t just voice your questions, voice them so everyone can hear them. It’s really important to over-communicate in a classroom. It’s ok to state the obvious, and it usually helps start the next conversation.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>When it comes to projects, you will always have more and bigger ideas than hours to bring them into existence. Focus on completing something simple, then blow it out!</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>There is a big difference between knowing a language and being able to solve programming problems with it, in the same way that having a large vocabulary does not mean you can write a compelling story.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Experimenting with Ruby&#8217;s syntax is awesome, because many of your experiments will work just like you thought they would. It is a language that is very readable and just makes sense.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Applying agile development to a learning environment would probably revolutionize the education system. I know, because I&#8217;m in a class that is doing it.</p>

<p><em>For instance, why doesn&#8217;t every class at least have a retrospective on completed projects, how the last week went, and the next could be improved? Somebody in the “system” has got to be experimenting with this, right?</em></p>
</li>

<li>
<p>I played a game of “Go” that involved voicing each players strategy as they made a move, along with reflection on other possible strategies after a stone was placed. Instead of a competition the game became akin to a pair programming session. In fact, it was one of the most fun and collaborative pairing sessions I have had.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>A few things that have furrowed my brow or made me smile this week.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>CSS selectors are ridiculous.</p>

<pre><code>  [class^=&quot;insanity&quot;] + mentalbreakdown{
      background-color: tears;
  }</code></pre>
</li>

<li>
<p>Inserting unicode characters into webpages is going to be the new <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> tag.</p>

<pre><code>  #portland:before{
      content: &quot;\2602&quot;
  }</code></pre>
</li>

<li>
<p>Ruby has an array method for almost EVERYTHING you can think of.</p>

<pre><code>  my_array.is_full_of_beans?
  my_array.fill_with_beans!</code></pre>
</li>

<li>
<p>Lastly, a passionate person can make any topic amazingly interesting, and an interesting topic life changing. Note to self, “be more passionate”.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><code>&lt;/ul&gt;</code></p>
