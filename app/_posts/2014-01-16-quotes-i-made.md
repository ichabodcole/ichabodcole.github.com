I like quotes, and I often find myself coming up with them when I want to build up a cognative and emotional context for some idea or project.

---

Below is a list of quotes I came up with in the process of writing a personal summary. No doubt they are probably all stolen or heavily inspired by other sentiments I have heard.

>Have humility to leap onto the shoulders of giants, and the acumen to jump off before hitting a tree branch.

>Don't tell me what you want, tell me why you want it.

>The most valuable people have the ability to adapt to and own an earthquake.

>People go with the defaults, so make your defaults really fucking amazing.

>What you produce defines your career, how you produce it defines your character.

>Plan, then execute. If you just execute you'll waste all your bullets, and you're still not comfortable with nunchucks.

>Conductors are the best managers, they lead without saying a word.
[Inspired by this amaze-balls TED talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/itay_talgam_lead_like_the_great_conductors.html)

>Imagine the ideal version of your future self in as much detail as possible, then start acting like that person. (If that person was Data from Startrek the Next Generation, congratulations, you are awesome.)

>Talent puts you in the early lead, sweat puts you on the podium.

>It's not what your willing to do, it's what your willing to give up (I completely stole this from someone, but it's one of my favorites).
