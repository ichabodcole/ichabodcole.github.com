Learning is an addicting skill. Once you've mastered something you once found daunting, you begin to realize that whole world really is up for grabs. You no longer spend your time fantasizing about an alternate you born with better genes, who speaks Japanese while cooking like a french chef. This isn't because you will have time to learn everything you want, but because you understand that there is nothing truly out of your reach, it only takes time and determination. There is a certain confidence that comes from learning a new thing, which no lack of natural talent can undermine. It tells you that even though you started at zero you have the ability to change.

With that said, confidence in the skill of learning is hard to impart, it must be experienced. Over the next few posts I'd like to impart a few core principals which I believe are essential to being a successful learner. I hope they make your journey to a skilled learner a little easier.

* The right kind of attitude
* Pragmatic Practice
* Patience beats talent
* Growth is uncomfortable
* Evaluate and acknowledge
